# üìÅ Folder-Aware Naming Convention

## General
- [ ] All filenames must include a scope prefix: `admin-`, `client-`, `shared-`, or org slug like `elpl-`, `bhb-`
- [ ] Avoid `index.html`, `main.css`, or `auth.js` unless scoped (e.g., `admin-auth.js`)
- [ ] Replace underscores `_` with hyphens `-` in all new filenames
- [ ] No duplicate filenames across trees (e.g., `auth.js` should only appear once per scope)

## HTML Pages
- [ ] Include function in filename: `goalsetter-live.html`, `review-session.html`
- [ ] Use suffixes to clarify page type: `-temp`, `-review`, `-live`, `-embed`
- [ ] Nested paths (e.g. `elpl/merit/`) should be reflected in file name when flattened

## JS/CSS Files
- [ ] Use `{tree}-{feature}.js`, e.g., `client-chat-loader.js`, `admin-review-session.js`
- [ ] Shared logic should always start with `shared-`
- [ ] Avoid generic names like `main.js`, `utils.js`‚Äîmake scope and purpose clear
- [ ] **Authorization files must follow:** `{org}-auth.js`, `{org}-user-auth.js`, `{org}-admin-auth.js`
  - Examples: `elpl-auth.js`, `elpl-user-auth.js`, `elpl-admin-auth.js`
  - This convention distinguishes base, user, and admin authentication layers by site
- [ ] Use `{tree}-{feature}.js`, e.g., `client-chat-loader.js`, `admin-review-session.js`
- [ ] Shared logic should always start with `shared-`
- [ ] Avoid generic names like `main.js`, `utils.js`‚Äîmake scope and purpose clear

## Page Ingredients & Components
- [ ] All partials in `page_ingredients/` must include their type and purpose
- [ ] Match JavaScript with component HTML: `toggle.html` ‚á® `toggle.js`
- [ ] Prefix component files by type if reused globally (e.g. `shared-form-welcome.html`)

# üß™ Validation
- [ ] Include naming check in pre-deploy script
- [ ] Rename legacy files before major version bump
- [ ] Spot check file tree weekly during sprint QA
