# Rule Writing Conventions (April 9, 2025)

## Rule File Structure
```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what the rule enforces
globs: ["pattern/to/match/*.ext"]
alwaysApply: true/false
---

# Rule Title (Date)

## Critical Rules
- ⚠️ Critical restrictions/warnings
- ✅ Approved actions/paths

## Implementation Details
- Key requirements
- Specific guidelines
```

## Standard Sections
1. **YAML Frontmatter** (Required)
   - `description`: One-line summary
   - `globs`: File patterns this rule applies to
   - `alwaysApply`: Whether rule should always be checked

2. **Title Block** (Required)
   - Rule name
   - Date of last update
   - Brief overview

3. **Critical Rules** (Required)
   - Use ⚠️ for warnings/restrictions
   - Use ✅ for approved actions
   - Keep points concise and clear

4. **Implementation Details** (Required)
   - Specific guidelines
   - Technical requirements
   - Code examples if needed

5. **Reference Documents** (Optional)
   - Link related docs with @ syntax
   - Example: @url-alignment-rules.mdc

## Formatting Conventions
1. **File Names**
   - Use kebab-case: `rule-name.mdc`
   - End with `.mdc` extension
   - Be descriptive but concise

2. **Markdown Usage**
   - Use ATX headers (#)
   - Use bullet points for lists
   - Use backticks for code/paths
   - Use blockquotes for notes

3. **Cross References**
   - Use @ syntax for files
   - Use relative paths
   - Link to specific sections if needed

4. **Code Examples**
   - Use triple backticks
   - Specify language
   - Keep examples minimal

## Rule Types
1. **Directory Rules**
   - Restrict file locations
   - Define structure

2. **Content Rules**
   - Code style
   - Documentation requirements

3. **Process Rules**
   - Workflow requirements
   - Review processes

4. **Security Rules**
   - Access controls
   - Authentication requirements

## Example Rule
```markdown
---
description: Controls access to production files
globs: ["**/prod/**/*.html"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Production Access Control

## Critical Rules
- ⚠️ NO direct edits to prod
- ✅ Use staging first

## Implementation
1. Create staging copy
2. Test thoroughly
3. Use deployment process
```

## Validation
- Rules must have frontmatter
- Rules must have critical section
- Rules must be dated
- Rules must reference related docs

## Reference Documents

- @development-cycle-rhythm.mdc
- @cursor-rules.mdc
