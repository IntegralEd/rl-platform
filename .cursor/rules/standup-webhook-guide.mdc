# Standup Report Webhook Integration Guide (Updated April 12, 2025)

This is the project-wide standard for standup reporting to Airtable via webhook. This document replaces all previous approaches.

## Sending the Payload via curl

Use the following command to send the JSON payload to the webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST https://hook.us1.make.com/2p4n1yv1urc4upm9xlkiy459t1yd87fj \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "Title": "Frontend_Cursor | YYYY.MM.DD.V",
    "ID": "YYYY-MM-DD-NNN",
    "Created": "'$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z")'",
    "Findings": [
      "Finding item 1",
      "Finding item 2",
      "Finding item 3"
    ],
    "Priorities": [
      "Priority item 1",
      "Priority item 2",
      "Priority item 3"
    ],
    "Next_Steps": [
      "Next step 1",
      "Next step 2",
      "Next step 3"
    ],
    "Future_Features": [
      "Feature idea 1",
      "Feature idea 2",
      "Feature idea 3"
    ]
  }'
```

## Report Format Requirements

- Include an incremental version number (YYYY.MM.DD.V format)
- Use unique Report_ID (YYYY-MM-DD-NNN format, where NNN = sequential number for the day)
- Specify frontend source (Report_Source: Frontend_Cursor)
- Include the author's name (User_ID: Your name)

## Complete Report JSON Format

```json
{
  "Title": "Frontend_Cursor | 2025.04.11.2",
  "ID": "2025-04-11-001",
  "Created": "2025-04-11T05:08:52.000Z",
  "Findings": [
    "Implemented new UI components for the dashboard",
    "Enhanced client-side validation for forms",
    "Improved error handling and logging",
    "Updated documentation for new features",
    "Validation on Softr not working, opened temporary access"
  ],
  "Priorities": [
    "Finalize UI/UX for the new dashboard",
    "Integrate with backend API for data fetching",
    "Conduct user testing for new features"
  ],
  "Next_Steps": [
    "Complete integration with backend services",
    "Optimize performance for mobile devices",
    "Prepare for the next release cycle"
  ],
  "Future_Features": [
    "Real-time data visualization",
    "Enhanced accessibility features",
    "Integration with third-party analytics"
  ]
}
```

## Field Mappings to Airtable

| JSON Field | Airtable Field | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Title | Report Title | Format: "Frontend_Cursor \| YYYY.MM.DD.V" |
| ID | Report ID | Format: YYYY-MM-DD-NNN |
| Created | Created At | ISO timestamp |
| Findings | Findings | Array of completed work items |
| Priorities | Priorities | Array of current focus areas |
| Next_Steps | Next Steps | Array of upcoming work |
| Future_Features | Future Features | Array of potential future work |

## Verification Steps

Before submitting, verify:

1. ✓ All required fields are present
2. ✓ Your ID and Title follow the required format conventions
3. ✓ Date format is correct (ISO 8601 format)
4. ✓ All arrays contain at least one item

## Implementation Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT attempt direct Airtable writes for standup reports
- Use ONLY the webhook approach documented here
- This method ensures proper security and consistent formatting
- For automated integration, see the documentation at `/docs/frontend_standup_guide.md`

## Usage

Follow this structure for all frontend reports.
Ensure consistency in formatting and content.
Use the JSON payload as a template for submissions.
This approach will help maintain clarity and uniformity in your standup reports and ensures proper integration with backend systems.
