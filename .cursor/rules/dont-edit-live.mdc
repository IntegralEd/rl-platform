# Live File Edit Restrictions (April 9, 2025)

## Critical Rules
- ⚠️ DO NOT edit `merit_live.html` or `merit_temp.html` without explicit authorization
- ⚠️ DO NOT modify any live files directly in production environments

## Approved Development Paths
- ✅ Focus admin panel behaviors on `/admin/pages/elpl/merit/merit_admin.html`
- ✅ Focus automation and enhancements on `/clients/elpl/merit/merit.html`
- ✅ All changes must follow style guide in @Admin Pages Layout.mdc
- ✅ Maintain URL conventions as per @url-alignment-rules.mdc

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Always work on development versions first
2. Use proper branching strategy for changes
3. Test thoroughly in development environment
4. Get explicit approval before touching live files
5. Document all changes in standup reports

## Affected Files
- `merit_live.html`
- `merit_temp.html`
- Any production-serving files

## Review Process

4. Maintain multitenant architecture
5. Preserve existing client functionality
