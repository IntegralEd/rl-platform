# RULESET INDEX

## Client Pages
- [ ] Enforce `client-layout.mdc` for all /clients/**/*.html pages

## Admin Pages
- [ ] Enforce `admin-layout.mdc` for all /admin/pages/**/*.html pages

## MDC Registration
- [ ] Each .mdc must include:
    - description block
    - globs definition
    - alwaysApply flag

## Enforcement Logic
- [ ] Rule globs must not overlap unless explicitly merged
- [ ] Rule conflicts must be resolved by naming scope
- [ ] Redundant checks should be centralized in this file only if shared

## Active Files (by responsibility)
- [ ] `client-layout.mdc` – layout and embed rules for public views
- [ ] `admin-layout.mdc` – layout and ingredient rules for admin UI
- [ ] `redis-api-access-patterns.mdc` – Redis access patterns, identity headers
