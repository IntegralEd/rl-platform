# ðŸ§± Admin Layout: Structure & Behavior

## Top Banner
- [ ] Exists on all pages with class `admin-banner`
- [ ] Height is exactly 50px
- [ ] Background is admin blue `#003366`
- [ ] Includes logo left, user/account info right
- [ ] Bottom-right contains version indicator

## Left Panel (Module Card System)
- [ ] Fixed width of 260px
- [ ] Modules are listed as cards with `module-card` class
- [ ] Active card has `expanded` class and shows gems and features
- [ ] Inactive cards collapse to 60px and only show name + status gems
- [ ] Status gems use `gem-dot` indicators per system service

## Right Panel (Dynamic Content)
- [ ] Uses `.tab-container` to control tab views
- [ ] Must include iFrame or dynamic panel render
- [ ] Content area must resize with browser window

## Status Tabs (Live/Temp)
- [ ] `_live.html` must include a status panel labeled "Live"
- [ ] `_temp.html` must show "Temporary Review" state label
- [ ] No edits permitted in these files without explicit override flag

## URL & File Structure Rules
- [ ] Pages must live in `/admin/pages/{client}/{activity}/{page}_admin.html`
- [ ] No nested subdirectories beyond `{client}/{activity}`
- [ ] All asset references must point to `/admin/assets/` or `/shared/assets/`
- [ ] JS and CSS files in `/admin/assets/` must follow naming conventions:
  - [ ] JS files must be prefixed with `admin-`, e.g., `admin-auth.js`, `admin-nav.js`
  - [ ] CSS files must reflect scope or layout role, e.g., `admin.css`, `header.css`, `sidebar.css`
- [ ] Pages must live in `/admin/pages/{client}/{activity}/{page}_admin.html`
- [ ] No nested subdirectories beyond `{client}/{activity}`
- [ ] All asset references must point to `/admin/assets/` or `/shared/assets/`

## Compliance Hooks
- [ ] Each module card includes `data-test-id="module-{name}"`
- [ ] Each tab has a `data-tab-id` attribute
- [ ] Version text is exposed with `data-version` attribute for testing

# âœ… Validation Strategy
- Use this file for automated pre-deploy layout checks
- Break build if any unchecked items remain
