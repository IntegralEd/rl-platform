# API Gateway CORS Configuration Guide - Merit Integration

This document provides implementation instructions for configuring CORS in the API Gateway for the Merit integration.

## Current Status

**✅ IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED**: Completed May 2, 2025
* All API Gateway resources correctly configured for CORS
* All preflight OPTIONS requests handled correctly across all environments
* Default 4XX and 5XX responses now include proper CORS headers
* Zero CORS errors reported in production since implementation

## Implementation Files

The following files contain the complete CORS configuration:

- [`api-gateway-cors-config.yaml`](./api-gateway-cors-config.yaml) - OpenAPI definition with CORS settings
- [`api-gateway-cloudformation-stack.yaml`](./api-gateway-cloudformation-stack.yaml) - CloudFormation deployment template
- [`api-gateway-monitoring.yaml`](./api-gateway-monitoring.yaml) - CloudWatch dashboard configuration

## Implementation Steps

1. **Import the OpenAPI Definition**:
   - Use the `api-gateway-cors-config.yaml` file to import the API definition
   - In the AWS Console, go to API Gateway → Create API → Import from OpenAPI

2. **Verify CORS Settings**:
   - Ensure all endpoints have proper CORS headers for OPTIONS requests
   - Verify that `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is set to `*` (wildcard for testing, will be restricted in production)
   - Ensure the headers include all required headers: `Content-Type`, `X-Amz-Date`, `Authorization`, `X-Api-Key`

3. **Gateway Response Configuration**:
   - Configure Gateway Responses for 4XX and 5XX errors to include CORS headers
   - This ensures CORS headers are sent even when errors occur

4. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Deploy the CloudWatch dashboard using the `api-gateway-monitoring.yaml` template
   - Set up alarms for 4XX/5XX error rates exceeding 5%
   - Configure logging for all API stages

5. **Testing CORS Configuration**:
   - Use browser developer tools to check for CORS errors
   - Verify OPTIONS preflight requests receive 200 responses with appropriate headers
   - Test actual API requests to confirm CORS headers are present in responses

## Integration with Client

The client-side Merit application expects the following CORS headers in responses:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key
Access-Control-Max-Age: 7200
```

These headers must be present in all API responses to allow cross-origin requests from the Merit client application.

## Verification Results

**Verification Date**: May 2, 2025
**Environments Tested**: Development, Staging, Production
**Results**: ✅ PASSED

- All preflight OPTIONS requests return 200 status with correct CORS headers
- All regular API responses include appropriate CORS headers
- Default 4XX and 5XX responses include CORS headers per specification
- Cache-Control headers properly set to 7200 seconds
- Zero CORS errors logged during production deployment verification
- Browser console shows no CORS-related warnings or errors during client operation

## Troubleshooting

If CORS errors persist after configuration:

1. Check browser console for specific CORS error messages
2. Verify that OPTIONS requests are properly handled with 200 responses
3. Ensure that all custom headers used in requests are included in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` list
4. Confirm that the API Gateway deployment was updated after CORS changes were made
