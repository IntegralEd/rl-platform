## The ORB Concept
We are many humans and agents collaborating in a project of recursive learning. This document is the One Ring To Bind them... When you log into Cursor to work on a repo, you will need to consult the ORB to stay in alignment with other frontend devs AND with the evolving REST-API protocols as we expand CORS and permissions and add clients and expand our tree.

We will be opening new fields to Redis and adjusting TTL to tune performance. We'll even be opening new tabs, switching from live to temp and synchronizing a multitenant stack. By having our own ORB, we are building each team and AI Agent's asynchronous context for the day's build so development snaps together like A-C-G-T.

The ORB is the microscopic robot reading streams of RNA and checking them for updates and evolutions in code.
