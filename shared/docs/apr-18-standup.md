# API Gateway Integration Standup - April 18, 2025

## Current Status: ðŸš¨ STILL BLOCKING
API Gateway configuration changes have been deployed but issues persist.

## Latest Test Results (14:00 UTC)

### 1. CORS Preflight (OPTIONS)
```bash
curl -X OPTIONS 'https://api.recursivelearning.app/prod/api/v1/context'
Status: 403
Error: "Missing Authentication Token"
```

### 2. Context Endpoint (POST)
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.recursivelearning.app/prod/api/v1/context'
Status: 403
Error: "Missing Authentication Token"
```

### 3. Mock Endpoint (POST)
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.recursivelearning.app/prod/api/v1/mock'
Status: 403
Error: "Missing Authentication Token"
```

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Method Integration
- [ ] OPTIONS method still returning 403
- [ ] POST method still failing with auth token error
- [ ] Integration request configuration may be incorrect

### 2. Auth Flow
- [ ] API Gateway not recognizing x-api-key header
- [ ] Auth validation happening before method integration
- [ ] CORS preflight blocked by auth check

### 3. Required Fixes
1. Move auth validation after method integration
2. Configure OPTIONS method to bypass auth
3. Update integration request mapping
4. Verify API key validation in correct stage

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Backend)
1. Check API Gateway deployment status
2. Verify method integration configuration
3. Update auth flow order
4. Test with mock integration first

### Frontend Changes (On Hold)
- Keep current client implementation
- Wait for backend confirmation before changes

## Timeline Impact
- Launch date (April 18) at risk
- Need immediate backend intervention
- Blocking all client-side testing

## Questions for Backend Team
1. Has the new configuration been deployed to prod?
2. Should OPTIONS bypass auth completely?
3. Is the integration request mapping correct?
4. Should we test in dev stage first?
