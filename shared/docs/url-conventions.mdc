# URL Conventions

## Overview
This document outlines the URL conventions for the Recursive Learning Platform, ensuring a consistent and organized structure across all projects.

## URL Set Descriptions

- **_live.html**
  - Location: `/clients/[client]/[project]/`
  - Purpose: Serves the production version of the project, displaying the finalized content to end users.

- **_temp.html**
  - Location: `/clients/[client]/[project]/`
  - Purpose: Used for staging or testing purposes, allowing for previewing changes before they go live.

- **_review.html**
  - Location: `/clients/[client]/[project]/`
  - Purpose: Facilitates review sessions, often with additional commenting or feedback features enabled.

- **_admin.html**
  - Location: `/admin/pages/[client]/[project]/`
  - Purpose: Provides administrative controls and settings for managing the project, accessible only to authorized users.

## Rules
- `_admin.html` pages should not be placed within the client tree.
- All admin pages must reside in the `/admin/pages/` directory structure to maintain a clear separation between client-specific and admin interfaces.
- Client-specific pages should reside within their respective client directories under `/clients/`.
- Shared assets and components should be placed in the `/shared/` directory to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
