# URL Conventions

## File Naming Patterns
- `_admin.html` - Admin interface pages
- `_live.html` - Production/live versions
- `_review.html` - Review session pages
- `_temp.html` - Temporary/preview versions

## Directory Structure Rules

### Admin Pages
- Pattern: `/admin/pages/{client}/{project}/_admin.html`
- Example: `/admin/pages/st/goalsetter/goalsetter_admin.html`
- All admin pages must be in the `/admin/pages/` directory
- Client-specific admin pages must be in their respective client subdirectories

### Client Pages
- Pattern: `/clients/{client}/{project}/{page}`
- Example: `/clients/st/goalsetter/goalsetter_live.html`
- All client-specific pages must be in the `/clients/` directory
- Each client should have their own subdirectory
- Project files should be grouped in project-specific subdirectories

### Review Pages
- Pattern: `/clients/{client}/{project}/_review.html`
- Example: `/clients/st/goalsetter/goalsetter_review.html`
- Review pages must be in their respective project directories
- Review pages are designed to be tokenized for review sessions

### Live/Production Pages
- Pattern: `/clients/{client}/{project}/_live.html`
- Example: `/clients/st/goalsetter/goalsetter_live.html`
- Production versions must be in their respective project directories
- These are the primary pages for iframe embedding

## Validation
- The admin tree interface validates these patterns
- Invalid paths will be flagged in the console
- URL validation is enforced through `admintree.js`

## Best Practices
1. Always use the appropriate suffix for page type
2. Maintain consistent naming between related files
3. Keep all project files in their designated directories
4. Use the admin tree interface to verify correct paths
5. Check console for URL convention violations

## Overview
This document outlines the URL conventions for the Recursive Learning Platform, ensuring a consistent and organized structure across all projects.

## URL Set Descriptions

- **_live.html**
  - Location: `/clients/[client]/[project]/`
  - Purpose: Serves the production version of the project, displaying the finalized content to end users.

- **_temp.html**
  - Location: `/clients/[client]/[project]/`
  - Purpose: Used for staging or testing purposes, allowing for previewing changes before they go live.

- **_review.html**
  - Location: `/clients/[client]/[project]/`
  - Purpose: Facilitates review sessions, often with additional commenting or feedback features enabled.

- **_admin.html**
  - Location: `/admin/pages/[client]/[project]/`
  - Purpose: Provides administrative controls and settings for managing the project, accessible only to authorized users.

## Rules
- `_admin.html` pages should not be placed within the client tree.
- All admin pages must reside in the `/admin/pages/` directory structure to maintain a clear separation between client-specific and admin interfaces.
- Client-specific pages should reside within their respective client directories under `/clients/`.
- Shared assets and components should be placed in the `/shared/` directory to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
