# Human-AI Code Review & Update Protocol

**Objective:** Systematically update HTML pages and asset paths while maintaining clear Git visibility for human review. AI handles code updates and Git commands, humans verify visual changes and approve commits.

## AI Assistant Rules
- [ai] Only modify HTML/CSS code, no documentation updates unless requested
- [x] Update build datetime tags to show fixed build time (not live clock)
- [x] Wait for human confirmation of tracked changes before committing
- [x] Use format: `"Update {component} - {change} [MMDDhhmm.YYYY]"` for commits
- [x] Handle precise git commands to prevent typos
- [x] Focus on one file at a time to maintain clear diffs
- [!] CRITICAL: AI cannot save files in Cursor - only humans can save changes
- [!] AI cannot detect unsaved changes in Cursor editor
- [!] AI can only see changes after human saves them to disk
- [!] AI will add "ðŸ›‘ STOP AND READ" after each file change

## Human Reviewer Rules
- [hu] Verify visual changes in browser before approving
- [x] Confirm Git status shows expected file changes
- [x] Watch for unintended cascade effects in styling
- [x] Note any new issues discovered during review
- [x] Lead decisions on folder restructuring
- [x] Handle quick file renames through IDE
- [x] Always save files after making changes (unsaved changes are lost if tab is closed)
- [x] Look for the dot indicator in tabs to identify unsaved changes
- [x] Verify 'M' appears in file tree after saving to confirm git tracking
- [!] ENABLE AUTO-SAVE: Open Cursor CLI and enable auto-save setting

ðŸ›‘ STOP AND READ: Don't close any tabs until you've saved all changes! Enable auto-save in Cursor CLI to prevent data loss.

## Cursor Save/Sync Behavior Notes
- Changes in editor are not written to disk until explicitly saved
- Unsaved changes show as a dot next to the file tab name
- Closing a tab with unsaved changes will lose those changes
- Git cannot see changes until they are saved to disk
- 'M' indicator in file tree confirms changes are saved and tracked
- Always save before git operations to ensure changes are tracked
- Multiple unsaved files can cause confusing git states
- Save one file at a time to maintain clear git history

## Today's Process
1. AI proposes code change
2. Human verifies in browser
3. Human confirms tracked changes visible
4. AI handles git commands
5. Both verify commit success
6. Repeat for next change

    ```
  - [x] Selection state properly tracked through navigation
  - [x] Form data preserved between sections

- **UI/UX Issues:**
  - [ ] Button states need improvement ("funky" states)
  - [ ] Icons need to be significantly larger
  - [ ] Remove blue overlay background (was meant as overlay only)
  - [ ] Focus on hover states and active indicators
  - [ ] Chat functionality shows errors when attempting to send messages
  - [ ] Form dropdown selections need visual refinement
  - [ ] Next button styling needs to match platform standards

- **Priority Fixes:**

  - [ ] Resolve OpenAI API domain resolution issues:
    - Verify API gateway endpoint is active and correctly configured
    - Check for correct DNS resolution on server
    - Add exponential backoff to retry logic
    - Implement offline mode fallback for testing
  - [ ] Fix form input validation with proper UX feedback
  - [ ] Increase icon sizes across the interface
  - [ ] Improve button state visual indicators
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages 
  - [ ] Add console logging to show which assistant is being called:
    - Log assistant ID/model in initialization
    - Add verbose logging for API requests
    - Include assistant information in state tracking
    - Add configuration logging on page load
  - [ ] Fix user identification issue:
    - Remove hardcoded "default_user" ID for new users
    - Set userId to null until properly assigned by Airtable
    - Implement proper user registration flow
    - Add user context logging for debugging
