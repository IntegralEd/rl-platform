## The ORB Concept
We are many humans and agents collaborating in a project of recursive learning. This document is the One Ring To Bind them... When you log into Cursor to work on a repo, you will need to consult the ORB to stay in alignment with other frontend devs AND with the evolving REST-API protocols as we expand CORS and permissions and add clients and expand our tree.

## Deployment Path
- Source: /admin/assets/rules/ORB.frontend-current
- Public: /admin/assets/rules/rlp-orb.html
- Access: Managed via admin CORS for safe embedding
- Distribution: Auto-piped to Slack and Softr instances
- Updates: RSS-style notifications for changes

## Active Build Context [merit.html/04132025.09:28am.v.1.15]
- Stage: 0 (Baseline)
- Project: Merit MVP Chat
- Version: v1.15
- Focus: Lambda endpoint integration

## Version Control
- Format: `{project}.html/MMDDYYYY.HH:MMam/pm.v.{version}`
- Time Zone: America/Chicago (Central)
- Current: merit.html/04132025.09:28am.v.1.15

## Update Protocol
1. Update signature: `MMDDYYYY.HHMMam/pm.username@team_cursor`
2. Include agent signature if using AI
3. Maintain version alignment
4. Reference existing behaviors with @ calls

  - Feature limitations
  - API rate limiting
  - Basic tool access
  - Community support only

- Premium User Rules
  - Advanced features
  - Higher API limits
  - Premium tool access
  - Priority support access

### 3. Client-Specific Rules
- Educational Institutions
  - Student data protection
  - Grade level appropriate tools
  - Parent portal access
  - District-wide settings

- Medical Practices
  - Patient data security

## Team Alignment Patterns
For 2 humans + 4 AI agents:

### 1. Daily Rhythm
- Morning: Human review of AI overnight work
- Midday: Paired programming sessions
- Evening: AI task delegation and monitoring

### 2. Communication Flow
- Humans: High-level direction and review
- Lead AI: Task distribution and coordination
- Support AIs: Specialized tasks and monitoring
- Wiki: Single source of truth

### 3. Decision Making
- Humans: Strategic decisions and approvals
- AI Lead: Implementation proposals
- Support AIs: Analysis and recommendations
- All: Wiki documentation

## Notes
- Keep version display consistent
- Reference behaviors with @ calls
- Monitor CORS configurations
- Validate deployment path
- Check RSS feed status
- Update wiki cards daily
- Review AI agent logs
