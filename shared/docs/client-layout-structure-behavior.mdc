# Client Layout Structure & Behavior Rules

## Overview
These rules define the standard structure and behavior for client pages across the Recursive Learning platform. They ensure consistency, maintainability, and proper functionality of client interfaces.

## Always Apply
- [ ] All client pages must follow these structural and behavioral patterns
- [ ] Deviations require explicit documentation and approval
- [ ] Changes to these rules must be version controlled

## Directory Structure
- [ ] Page-specific files must stay with their HTML page:
  ```
  /clients/{client}/{project}/
    ├── project.html
    ├── .env            # Client-specific environment variables
    └── assets/
        └── js/
            └── client-project-logic.js  # Controls this specific page
  ```
- [ ] Shared client assets must be in `/clients/{client}/assets/` for reuse:
  - JS files in `/assets/js/` (auth, routing, shared utilities)
  - CSS files in `/assets/css/` (shared styles)
  - Images in `/assets/images/` (shared icons, logos, SVGs)
  - Variables in `/assets/variables.css` (client-wide variables)
- [ ] Page ingredients must be in `/shared/page_ingredients/{ingredient}/`

## Environment Variables
- [ ] Platform-level variables in `/shared/platform/env.config`:
  - OpenAI API key and project ID
  - Infrastructure configurations (VPC, subnets, etc.)
  - API Gateway settings
- [ ] Client-level variables in `/clients/{client}/{project}/.env`:
  - Client-specific assistant IDs
  - Client-specific organization IDs (e.g., Airtable)
  - Project-specific configurations
