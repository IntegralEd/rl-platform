# Admin Layout Structure & Behavior Rules

## Overview
These rules define the standard structure and behavior for admin pages across the Recursive Learning platform. They ensure consistency, maintainability, and proper functionality of admin interfaces.

## Always Apply
- [ ] All admin pages must follow these structural and behavioral patterns
- [ ] Deviations require explicit documentation and approval
- [ ] Changes to these rules must be version controlled

## Directory Structure
- [ ] Admin-specific assets must be in `/admin/assets/`
  - JS files in `/admin/assets/js/`
  - CSS files in `/admin/assets/css/`
  - Images in `/admin/assets/images/`
- [ ] Admin components must be in `/admin/components/`
- [ ] Admin pages must be in `/admin/pages/{client}/{project}/`
  - Must include `.env` for project-specific variables
  - Must follow client variable structure for consistency
- [ ] Page ingredients must be in `/shared/page_ingredients/{ingredient}/`

## Environment Variables
- [ ] Platform-level variables in `/shared/platform/env.config`:
  - OpenAI API key and project ID (shared across platform)
  - Infrastructure configurations
  - API Gateway settings
- [ ] Admin-level variables in `/admin/pages/{client}/{project}/.env`:
