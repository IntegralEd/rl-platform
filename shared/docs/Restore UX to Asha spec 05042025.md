## Steps to Resolve Console Errors and Missing Elements

1. **Ensure Elements Exist:**
   - Verify that elements like `nextButton`, `sendButton`, `chatInput`, `chatWindow`, `gradeSelect`, and `footer` are present in the HTML.

2. **Define Missing Functions:**
   - Implement `updateButtonState` and `updateLaunchButton` functions if they are not defined.

3. **Check Event Listeners:**
   - Ensure all elements referenced in event listeners are correctly initialized and exist in the DOM.

4. **Comment Out API Calls:**
   - Ensure all API calls are commented out for testing purposes.

5. **Verify File Paths:**
   - Ensure all JavaScript files are correctly referenced and exist in the specified paths.

6. **Fix Uncaught Errors:**
   - Address `Uncaught ReferenceError` and `Uncaught TypeError` by ensuring all referenced elements and functions are defined and accessible.

7. **Handle Missing Elements in Dev Mode:**
   - Address warnings about missing elements in development mode by ensuring all required elements are present or conditionally handled in the code.

## Needed Event Listeners and Function Integrations

1. **Ensure `updateButtonState` is Called**:
   - Make sure `updateButtonState` is called whenever the form state changes, such as when a grade is selected or deselected.

2. **Define Missing Functions**:
   - Ensure that `updateLaunchButton` is defined and correctly updates the launch button state based on the current selections.

3. **Integrate Event Listeners**:
   - Ensure that all event listeners are correctly set up in `client-merit-instructional-flow.js` and are tied to the elements in `merit.html`.

4. **Verify Element IDs and Classes**:
   - Double-check that the IDs and classes used in `merit.html` match those expected by the event listeners in `client-merit-instructional-flow.js`.

5. **Document Changes**:
   - Update this document to reflect the need for these event listeners and function integrations to ensure the functionality is correctly implemented.
