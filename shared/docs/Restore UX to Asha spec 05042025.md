## Fixes Needed Based on Console Errors 12:51pm

1. **Ensure Elements Exist**: (Done)
   - Verified that elements like `nextButton`, `sendButton`, `chatInput`, `chatWindow`, `gradeSelect`, and `footer` are present in the HTML.

2. **Check Element IDs and Classes**: (In Progress)
   - **nextButton**: Mismatch between `.client-welcome__next-button` in HTML and `nextButton` in JS. Update needed.
   - **sendButton**: Correctly corresponds.
   - **chatInput**: Correctly corresponds.
   - **chatWindow**: Correctly corresponds.
   - **gradeSelect**: Mismatch between `grade-level` in HTML and `gradeSelect` in JS. Update needed.
   - **footer**: Correctly corresponds.

3. **Initialize Button States**:
   - Call `updateLaunchButton` during the initial setup to ensure the button states are correctly initialized.

4. **Fix Uncaught Errors**:
   - Address `Uncaught TypeError` by ensuring all elements referenced in event listeners are correctly initialized and exist in the DOM.

5. **Verify Script Integration**:
   - Ensure that the script tags in `merit.html` correctly reference the JavaScript files and that the functions are called in the appropriate places.

6. **Debug Missing Elements**:
   - Investigate why elements like `footer`, `nextButton`, `sendButton`, `chatInput`, `chatWindow`, and `gradeSelect` are reported as missing and ensure they are correctly rendered in the DOM.
