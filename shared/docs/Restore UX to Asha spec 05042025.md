## Steps to Resolve Console Errors and Missing Elements
The merit.html file includes several sections that need to be connected to the event listeners and functions defined in client-merit-instructional-flow.js. Here are the key points to ensure proper integration:
Import Functions: Ensure that updateButtonState and updateLaunchButton are exported from client-merit-instructional-flow.js and imported into merit.html.
Event Listeners:
Grade Options: Ensure that clicking on grade options toggles their selection and updates the button state using updateButtonState.
Next Button: Ensure the next button's state is updated based on the selected grades and that it triggers the appropriate actions when clicked.
Initial Setup:
Call updateLaunchButton during the initial setup to ensure the button states are correctly initialized.
Ensure Correct IDs and Classes: Verify that the IDs and classes used in merit.html match those expected by the event listeners in client-merit-instructional-flow.js.
Script Integration: Ensure that the script tags in merit.html correctly reference the JavaScript files and that the functions are called in the appropriate places.
