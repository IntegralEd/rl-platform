# Frontend Standup Report - April 7, 2023 - 02

## Team Member(s)
- David

## Accomplishments
- Created temporary admin authentication bypass for direct access
- Identified and addressed Softr field naming inconsistency issues
- Created frontend standup guide document based on backend template

## Current Work
- Implementing admin direct access mode for temporary use
- Debugging Softr integration authentication issues
- Improving field access patterns for Softr user data

## Blockers
- Softr inconsistently exposes Airtable fields in the `logged_in_user` object
- Field `Name` is actually stored as `First Name` in Softr object
- Dot notation access fails for fields with underscores like `IE_Role_Level`

## Integration Notes
- When accessing Softr user data, bracket notation must be used: `window.logged_in_user['IE_Role_Level']`
- Field mappings are inconsistent between Airtable and Softr
- Added fallbacks for multiple field name formats in headerspan script
- Console logs show user role is properly accessed with bracket notation
- The temporary bypass approach injects a simulated admin user when needed

## Technical Details
- Modified `/shared/assets/js/softr_headerspan.js` to add `BYPASS_AUTH` flag
- Created `/admin/direct.html` as a simplified admin interface without auth
- Updated user data access to handle different field naming conventions
- Created `/shared/docs/standup-reports/admin-auth-bypass-note.mdc` with documentation

## Next Steps
- Test direct.html access at recursivelearning.app/admin/direct.html
- Document Softr field mapping comprehensively for future reference
- Schedule permanent fix to standardize all Softr data access patterns
- Review all files using Softr data access to ensure bracket notation is used

## Screenshots/Demos
- Console log showing user data format:
```
Softr user data: {
  airtable_record_id: 'recqEg127R9HgscOB', 
  record_id: 'recqEg127R9HgscOB', 
  First Name: 'David',  // Note: This field is not called "Name"
  Email: 'david@integral-ed.com', 
  Phone: '+17183086821',
  IE_Role_Level: 'Org Admin'  // This field needs bracket notation
}
```
