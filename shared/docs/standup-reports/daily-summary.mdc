# April 6 Daily Summary

## Overview
Today we made significant progress integrating the frontend with backend services and enhancing our development workflow.

## Key Achievements

### Backend Integration
- Implemented chat loader module with asynchronous component initialization
- Created CloudWatch integration for metrics and performance monitoring 
- Developed API client for secure backend communication
- Built URL resolver for dynamic component loading

### Documentation & Process
- Created standup report publishing system connected to Airtable
- Standardized standup report format with templates
- Established workflow for sharing daily progress via Slack
- Added comprehensive integration guides

### Completed Components
- Chat component with encryption, persistence, and reconnection capabilities
- Review token system for external collaborators
- CloudWatch integration with sampling to control costs
- Standup report parser and formatter

## Current Status
We're on track with the backend integration priorities and have completed the first phase of chat component development. The system now supports:

1. Asynchronous chat loading without blocking page rendering
2. Secure message persistence between sessions
3. Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
4. URL-based context awareness
5. Centralized standup reporting

## Next Steps
For tomorrow, we will focus on:
1. Completing the chat pagination implementation
2. Adding typing indicators and read receipts
3. Starting work on bulk comment management tools
4. Testing CloudWatch integration with real traffic data

## Team Coordination
With the new Airtable-based standup system, frontend and backend teams can better coordinate efforts. The structured reporting allows for easier tracking of progress and identification of blockers or dependencies between teams.

## Branch Status
All changes have been committed to the `backend-integration` branch, which will be ready for review soon.
