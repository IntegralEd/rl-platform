# Frontend Standup Report 04 - April 7

## Summary
Implementing temporary admin auth bypass and documenting Softr field naming patterns for development access. Aligning with backend team's standup reporting format.

## Current Build Features

### Admin Access System
- Implemented temporary auth bypass for development
- Created direct.html access point for admin tree
- Documented Softr field naming patterns
- Updated frontend standup guide to match backend format

### Field Access Patterns
- Using bracket notation for Softr fields: `window.logged_in_user['IE_Role_Level']`
- Documented field naming inconsistencies
- Created access pattern documentation

## Completed Tasks

### Auth Bypass Implementation
- Created direct.html access point
- Implemented development mode toggle
- Added trusted domain list
- Documented access patterns

### Documentation Updates
- Updated frontend standup guide
- Created field naming documentation
- Aligned with backend team's format
- Added access pattern examples

## Test Results

### Test Case: AUTH-01 (Direct Access)
- **Hypothesis**: Direct access should work without auth checks
- **Test Method**: Accessed recursivelearning.app/admin/direct.html
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully accessed admin tree
- **Notes**: Development mode enabled

### Test Case: FIELD-01 (Softr Field Access)
- **Hypothesis**: Bracket notation should access fields correctly
- **Test Method**: Accessed window.logged_in_user['IE_Role_Level']
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully accessed field
- **Notes**: Field name confirmed correct

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Field Name Inconsistency
Softr field names didn't match expected format, causing access issues.

**Solution**:
1. Documented actual field names from console
2. Implemented bracket notation access
3. Created field mapping documentation
4. Added development mode bypass

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Admin Access
- Test direct access in production
- Monitor Airtable for field updates
- Document any new field patterns
- Prepare for permanent auth solution

## Future Integrations
- Permanent auth solution implementation
- Field name standardization
- Automated field mapping
- Production access controls

## Predicted Outcomes for Next Standup
For our next standup, we anticipate:
1. Confirmed field naming patterns
2. Production access testing results
3. Updated field documentation
4. Auth solution progress

## CTO Review Notes
Temporary auth bypass implemented for development. Field access patterns documented. Monitoring Airtable for updates.
