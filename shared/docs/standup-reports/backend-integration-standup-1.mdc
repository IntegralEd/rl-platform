# Backend Integration Standup Report #1

## Summary of Actions
1. Created dedicated `backend-integration` branch for this integration effort
2. Explored backend REST API requirements in `rl-restapi-lambda` repo
3. Updated `backend-integration-checklist.mdc` with alignment to backend requirements
4. Created comprehensive `backend-integration-test-plan.mdc` with test cases
5. Developed `frontend-implementation-guide.mdc` with practical code examples

## Key Findings

### API Integration Structure
- Backend uses AWS API Gateway with Lambda functions
- Base URL: `https://{api-id}.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/{environment}/api/v1/context`
- Requires specific headers: Content-Type, X-API-Key, X-Session-Token, X-Client-ID, X-Project-ID

### Authentication System
- JWT-based token authentication aligns well with our existing system
- We need to store token in sessionStorage and include in all API requests
- Our existing URL parameter-based authentication can be extended for this integration
- Review token system we developed is compatible with backend expectations

### URL Patterns and Endpoints
- Our existing URL structure (`_live.html`, `_review.html`, etc.) maps directly to backend endpoints
- Backend uses client and project identifiers from URL paths for routing
- Each URL pattern type has a corresponding API endpoint:
  - `*_live.html` → `/api/v1/{client}/{project}/content`
  - `*_review.html` → `/api/v1/{client}/{project}/review/{token}`
  - `*_temp.html` → `/api/v1/{client}/{project}/preview`
  - `*_admin.html` → `/api/v1/admin/{client}/{project}`

### Role-Based Access
- Backend implements granular role-based permissions through Airtable
- Our UI needs to conditionally render elements based on these permissions
- We've developed a pattern for permission checking in the frontend:
  ```javascript
  function hasPermission(permissionName) {
    const userPermissions = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('userPermissions'));
    return userPermissions && userPermissions.includes(permissionName);
  }
  ```

### Monitoring Integration
- Backend expects client-side error reporting to CloudWatch
- We need to implement performance timing metrics
- API usage tracking and error logging should be standardized

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Sprint)
1. Implement the core API client with proper headers and error handling
2. Develop the authentication integration with token validation
3. Create basic test harness for API endpoints with mocked responses
4. Begin implementing content retrieval based on page types

### First Test Implementation
We recommend starting with the `AUTH-01` test case (valid JWT authentication) because:
- It's foundational to all other integration points
- Provides immediate feedback on connection configuration
- Validates our JWT handling approach
- Simplest to implement with clear success criteria

### Expected Test Outcome
For the `AUTH-01` test (valid JWT authentication test):
- **Prediction**: Partial success with potential CORS issues
- **Expected Issues**: 
  - CORS headers may not be fully configured on the backend
  - API key validation might fail initially
  - Token format may need adjustment
- **Resolution Path**: Coordinate with backend team to verify CORS settings and provide proper API keys for testing

## CTO Review

The integration approach outlined is sound and follows best practices for frontend-backend integration. Some observations from a strategic perspective:

1. **Security Strengths**: The JWT-based authentication with role-based access control provides a robust security model that scales well with our multi-tenant architecture.

2. **Technical Debt Considerations**: The client token mapping (`st` → `schoolteacher`, etc.) creates coupling that should be monitored. Consider moving this mapping to a configuration endpoint in the future.

3. **DevOps Impact**: The CloudWatch integration will provide valuable insights but requires proper IAM permissions and monitoring setup. Ensure this is coordinated with the infrastructure team.

4. **Scalability**: The approach to content retrieval with URL-based routing is clean and maintainable. We should pay attention to caching strategies as usage grows.

5. **Developer Experience**: The frontend implementation guide provides clear patterns for developers to follow, which will help maintain consistency across the codebase.

Overall, this integration sets a solid foundation for the platform's growth while maintaining security and scalability. The test plan ensures we can validate each component methodically.

**Approved to proceed with the implementation plan as outlined.**
