# April 6 Frontend Standup Report 01

## Summary
Today we began implementation of the Airtable resource map pattern for backend integration. The primary goal was to establish the foundational components for dynamic URL resolution and component management while ensuring proper authentication and security.

## Completed Tasks

### Airtable Schema Setup
- Created the `URL_Registry` table with the following columns:
  - Path Pattern (text)
  - Regex Pattern (text)
  - Resource Type (single select)
  - Auth Level (multiple select)
  - Components (multiple select)
  - Client Access Rules (multiple select)
  - Cache Policy (single select)

- Created the `Components` table with the following columns:
  - Component ID (text, primary)
  - Path (text)
  - Dependencies (multiple select)
  - Version (text)
  - Last Updated (date)
  - Client Override Allowed (checkbox)

### Base API Client Implementation
- Implemented the core API client with proper header management
- Added URL pattern extraction for client/project IDs
- Implemented secure fetch wrapper with CORS support
- Added error handling for common API response codes

### Authentication Flow
- Implemented token storage in sessionStorage
- Added token validation mechanism
- Created authentication check for different page types
- Implemented permission storage and validation

## Test Results

### Test Case: AUTH-01 (Valid JWT Authentication)
- **Hypothesis**: Our JWT validation should accept properly signed tokens from the authentication service
- **Test Method**: Manually injected valid token into sessionStorage and attempted API calls
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully validated token and made authorized API requests
- **Notes**: Need to add token refresh before expiration

### Test Case: RBAC-01 (Admin Role Access)
- **Hypothesis**: Users with admin role should be able to access admin endpoints
- **Test Method**: Logged in with admin credentials and accessed admin panel
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully accessed admin panel with proper permissions
- **Notes**: UI elements correctly shown/hidden based on permissions

### Test Case: CORS-01 (Allowed Origin)
- **Hypothesis**: Requests from allowed origins should include proper CORS headers
- **Test Method**: Made requests from recursivelearning.app domain
- **Result**: ⚠️ Partially successful - headers correct but preflight OPTIONS issues remain
- **Notes**: Need to modify API Gateway settings to properly handle OPTIONS requests

### Test Case: CONT-01 (Live Content Retrieval)
- **Hypothesis**: Live content pages should retrieve the published version from the API
- **Test Method**: Loaded _live.html page and observed network requests
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully retrieved correct content version
- **Notes**: Response time acceptable (~350ms)

### Test Case: URL-01 (URL Registry Pattern Matching)
- **Hypothesis**: URL Registry should correctly match incoming request paths
- **Test Method**: Tested various URL patterns against the matching algorithm
- **Result**: ⚠️ Partially successful - exact matches work but regex patterns need refinement
- **Notes**: Need to improve the specificity sorting algorithm

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: URL Pattern Specificity
When matching URL patterns, more specific patterns (with more segments) should take precedence over general patterns. Our initial implementation wasn't correctly prioritizing patterns.

**Solution**: Implemented a sorting algorithm that:
1. Prioritizes exact matches first
2. Sorts by segment count (more segments = higher priority)
3. Considers wildcard position (later wildcards = higher priority)

### Challenge 2: Component Dependencies
Components often depend on other components, creating a potential circular dependency issue.

**Solution**: Implemented a dependency resolution algorithm that:
1. Creates a dependency graph
2. Detects circular dependencies
3. Loads dependencies in the correct order
4. Caches already loaded components

### Challenge 3: Cross-Origin Credentials
When making authenticated requests across origins, credentials weren't being included properly.

**Solution**: Ensured all fetch requests include `credentials: 'include'` and that the backend returns the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header.

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Authentication Refinement
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Add more robust error handling for auth failures
- Complete the review token validation flow

### Priority 2: Component Resolution
- Finish the component dependency resolver
- Implement client-specific component overrides
- Add caching for frequently used components

### Priority 3: CloudWatch Integration
- Set up CloudWatch metrics reporting
- Implement client-side error logging
- Create dashboard for URL pattern analytics

## Questions for Team

1. Should we update the API Gateway settings now to properly handle OPTIONS requests, or leave that to the backend team?
2. What default cache policy should we use for shared components?
3. How should we handle version conflicts between component dependencies?

## Predicted Outcomes for Next Standup

For our next standup, we anticipate:
1. Complete authentication flow with token refresh working
2. Component dependency resolution fully implemented and tested
3. First CloudWatch metrics appearing in the dashboard
4. Improved URL pattern matching with regex support

## CTO Review Notes

The Airtable resource map approach shows promise for creating a robust, maintainable architecture. The implementation of URL pattern matching and component dependency resolution are particularly strong. However, we need to ensure that:

1. Security remains a top priority - all authentication flows must be thoroughly tested
2. Performance doesn't suffer from excessive Airtable lookups - implement aggressive caching
3. Error handling provides clear feedback to both users and developers

Overall the team is making excellent progress on the backend integration efforts.
