## Status Indicators

The admin dashboard uses a three-dot status system to monitor the health of each learning activity:

### API Integration Status (Left Dot)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Active** - API is connected and responding within expected latency (<300ms)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning** - API is responding but with high latency (>300ms)
- ðŸ”´ **Error** - API connection failed or timeout

### Form Validation Status (Middle Dot)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Active** - All form submissions passing validation (>95%)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning** - Some form validation failures (85-95% pass rate)
- ðŸ”´ **Error** - High form validation failure rate (<85% pass rate)

### User Sessions Status (Right Dot)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Active** - Normal user session activity
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning** - Elevated error rates in user sessions (>5%)
- ðŸ”´ **Error** - Critical user session issues or system errors (>10%)

### Implementation
Each admin page broadcasts these statuses using the postMessage API:

```javascript
window.parent.postMessage({
    type: 'status',
    activity: 'goalsetter', // or 'merit', 'bhb'
    status: [
        {state: 'active', message: 'API: 245ms response time'},
        {state: 'warning', message: 'Forms: 92% validation rate'},
        {state: 'error', message: 'Sessions: 15% error rate'}
    ]
}, '*');
```

Status updates are sent:
1. On page load
2. Every 30 seconds
3. After significant events (form submission, API calls)
