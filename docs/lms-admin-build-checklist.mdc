# Autonomous Build Checklist - Admin System

## 🎯 Build Parameters
- Max autonomous steps: 25
- Tech constraints: Use existing stack only
- Tree respect: Follow current /shared/admin structure
- Testing: Unit-first approach
- Reporting: Generate standup notes at key points

## 📊 Current State
```
/shared/admin/
├── pages/goalsetter.html  # Admin dashboard
├── css/admin.css         # Styles
└── js/
    └── monitor.js       # Health checks
```

## 🔄 Phase 1: Test Infrastructure (Steps 1-8)
```javascript
// Expected test structure
/shared/admin/tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── monitor.test.js
│   └── state.test.js
└── integration/
    └── health.test.js
```

### Unit Tests (Steps 1-4)
- [ ] Test state persistence
- [ ] Test health check methods
- [ ] Test Qipu reporting
- [ ] Test dashboard updates

### Integration Tests (Steps 5-8)
- [ ] Test page state transitions
- [ ] Test monitoring cycle
- [ ] Test alert triggers
- [ ] Test report generation

🛑 DECISION POINT 1: Test coverage report
Options:
1. Continue to Phase 2 if coverage > 80%
2. Add more unit tests if critical paths uncovered
3. Request human review if blockers found

## 🔍 Phase 2: Monitoring Enhancement (Steps 9-16)
```javascript
// Enhanced monitor.js structure
const Monitor = {
    core: {}, // existing
    capture: {}, // new screenshot
    diff: {}, // new visual diff
    alert: {} // new alerting
}
```

### Screenshot System (Steps 9-12)
- [ ] Implement html2canvas wrapper
- [ ] Add element targeting
- [ ] Create storage handler
- [ ] Add diff preparation

### Alert System (Steps 13-16)
- [ ] Define alert thresholds
- [ ] Create alert queue
- [ ] Implement batching
- [ ] Add priority levels

🛑 DECISION POINT 2: System stability check
Options:
1. Proceed if all tests pass
2. Rollback if memory usage high
3. Request human review if new patterns needed

## 🎨 Phase 3: Visual Regression (Steps 17-20)
```javascript
// Diff engine approach
const DiffEngine = {
    compare: async (base, current) => {
        const diff = await pixelmatch(base, current);
        return {
            changes: diff.changes,
            regions: diff.regions,
            score: diff.score
        };
    }
}
```

### Core Features
- [ ] Implement pixel comparison
- [ ] Add region detection
- [ ] Create diff visualization
- [ ] Store baseline images

🛑 DECISION POINT 3: Performance check
Options:
1. Continue if diff time < 2s
2. Optimize if slow
3. Fallback to simple diff

## 📈 Phase 4: Reporting System (Steps 21-25)
```javascript
// Report structure
{
    timestamp: ISO8601,
    health: {
        score: 0-100,
        issues: []
    },
    visuals: {
        diffs: [],
        score: 0-100
    },
    alerts: {
        active: [],
        resolved: []
    }
}
```

### Implementation
- [ ] Create report builder
- [ ] Add trend detection
- [ ] Implement alert summary
- [ ] Add action suggestions
- [ ] Create standup format

🛑 FINAL DECISION POINT
Options:
1. Deploy if all tests pass
2. Run extended tests
3. Request human review

## 🧪 Test Scenarios
```javascript
describe('Monitor System', () => {
    test('should detect page state changes', async () => {
        const monitor = new Monitor();
        const state = await monitor.checkState();
        expect(state.health.score).toBeGreaterThan(80);
    });
});
```

## 📝 Success Criteria
- Unit test coverage > 80%
- Alert response < 30s
- Diff accuracy > 95%
- Memory usage < 100MB
- Zero new dependencies

## 🚨 Abort Conditions
1. Test coverage drops below 70%
2. Memory usage exceeds 150MB
3. Alert latency > 1min
4. New security vulnerabilities
5. Tree structure violations

## 📊 Metrics Collection
```javascript
const metrics = {
    collect: async () => ({
        coverage: await TestRunner.getCoverage(),
        memory: process.memoryUsage(),
        timing: Monitor.getLatencyStats(),
        alerts: Alert.getResponseTimes()
    })
}
```

## 🔄 Rollback Plan
1. Store state pre-changes
2. Keep baseline screenshots
3. Version test results
4. Maintain metric history

## 👥 Human Review Triggers
1. New pattern detection
2. Coverage gaps
3. Performance anomalies
4. Security concerns
5. Tree conflicts
